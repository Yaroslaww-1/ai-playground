# AI-playground
Pac-Man game implementation using some foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. Based on [UC Berkeley CS188 Intro to AI course](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html).

# Status
- Lab 1 - [basic-game](https://github.com/Yaroslaww-1/ai-playground/tree/lab1-basic-game)

Basic pacman game implementation

- Lab 2 - [basic-search](https://github.com/Yaroslaww-1/ai-playground/tree/lab2-basic-search)

Made enemy intelligent. They are now searching for player by using dfs/bfs algorithms.

- Lab 3 - [auto-game](https://github.com/Yaroslaww-1/ai-playground/tree/lab3-auto-game)

Added A* algorithm.

- Lab 4 - [minimax](https://github.com/Yaroslaww-1/ai-playground/tree/lab4-minimax)

Implemented Minimax.

- Lab 5 - [forecasting](https://github.com/Yaroslaww-1/ai-playground/tree/lab5-forecasting)

Forecasted future results by using linear regression.

- Lab 6 - [lisp](https://github.com/Yaroslaww-1/ai-playground/tree/lab6-lisp)

Implemented minimax using LISP (using hy language).
